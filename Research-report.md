# 🏙️ Delhi Air Quality Analysis Using Data Mining Techniques

## 📘 1. Introduction

Delhi, the capital of India, is consistently ranked among the most polluted cities in the world. Air pollution poses severe threats to public health, environment, and overall quality of life. Key contributors include vehicular emissions, industrial waste, biomass burning, stubble burning in nearby states, and adverse meteorological conditions.

This project performs a **data-driven exploratory and predictive analysis** using the [Delhi Air Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kunshbhatia/delhi-air-quality-dataset) to identify **trends, patterns, correlations, and causal relationships** behind pollution in Delhi. It also connects findings with **real-world events and policies**, such as the COVID-19 lockdown, Diwali, stubble burning, and the Odd-Even traffic policy.

---

## 🎯 2. Objectives

- Analyze how Delhi’s air quality has changed over the years.
- Study **seasonal variations** in air quality.
- Identify **key pollutants** that degrade air quality.
- Compare air quality across **different monitoring stations**.
- Explore **correlations** between pollutants.
- Evaluate the **impact of interventions** (e.g., lockdowns, stubble burning).
- Check compliance with **WHO safety standards**.
- Detect **monthly and seasonal outliers**.
- Perform **predictive modeling** to forecast AQI trends.

## 📚 3. Literature Review

Prior studies have explored Delhi’s air pollution crisis using atmospheric science and data analytics:

- **Guttikunda & Calori (2013):** Found vehicular emissions as the largest PM2.5 contributor.  
- **Beig et al. (2020):** Established correlation between meteorological parameters and pollutant dispersion.  
- **Sharma et al. (2021):** Documented drastic pollutant reduction during the COVID-19 lockdown.  
- **Singh et al. (2019):** Showed pollution peaks during winter due to stubble burning and temperature inversion.

However, few studies combine **multi-year, multi-pollutant** data for temporal, spatial, and predictive analysis.  
This project aims to bridge that gap using **modern data mining and visualization techniques**.

## 💡 6. Analysis Philosophy and Design

This project follows an **iterative, data-driven workflow**, inspired by the **CRISP-DM** methodology:

1. **Business Understanding** → Define objectives and real-world relevance.  
2. **Data Understanding** → Explore data quality and sources.  
3. **Data Preparation** → Clean, transform, and enrich data.  
4. **Modeling** → Build regression/classification/time-series models.  
5. **Evaluation** → Assess performance and interpret results.  
6. **Deployment** → Visualize findings and derive insights.

## 📉 7. Findings (Illustrative)

*(You can update this section with actual results after analysis.)*

- **Trend:** Air quality deteriorated from 2018–2019, improved in 2020 during lockdown, and worsened again post-2021.  
- **Seasonal Variation:** Winter (Nov–Jan) shows severe pollution, while monsoon (Jul–Sep) shows improvement.  
- **Major Pollutants:** PM2.5 and PM10 are primary drivers of poor AQI.  
- **Spatial Trends:** Central and industrial zones consistently show higher AQI.  
- **Event Impact:** Diwali and stubble burning create sharp pollution spikes; lockdowns cause significant drops.  
- **Correlation:** PM2.5–PM10 correlation ≈ 0.85, indicating shared sources.  
- **Outliers:** November 2019 and 2021 were extreme pollution months.
